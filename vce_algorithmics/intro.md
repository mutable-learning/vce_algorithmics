# VCE Algorithmics

### A textbook for students studying the Algorithmics (HESS) Units 3 & 4 course as part of their Victorian Certificate of Education studies.

Algorithmics is the study of a solving real-world, practical problems through the use of computational methods. Computer science and software engineering have algorithmics as their core foundation, and it is through the use and application of algorithmics that much of modern society's technology has been created. Although algorithmics is viewed as being of and for computational thinking and applications, it also provides a discipline of rational thought that can be seen as a methodical approach to problem-solving in general.

Algorithmics (HESS) Units 3 & 4:
- examines how information can be systematically represented
- shows how processes can be made explicit and precise allowing for implementation as part of a software solution 
- focuses on 'algorithmic thinking', not coding
- analyses real-world problems to identify key aspects that must be modelled to find solutions
- explores the design of algorithms
- provides a framework for manipulating and reasoning about structured information

Along with the above, the course also uses mathematical techniques to validate the performance of algorithms and determine how they scale to the size of the problem to be solved.

Finally, Algorithmics (HESS) also introduces students to related and deeper topics in computer science such as:
- artificial intelligence
- statistical methods of computation
- ethical concerns arising from the above points

This text has been created to support the Algorithmics (HESS) Units 3 & 4 Study Design (2023 - 2026). It follows the study design closely and covers all the key knowledge and key skills outlined in the course. There are also questions within each section to test your knowledge and skills with the course content, and the text is structured in a way that students will be able to use the content, pseudocode and Python examples to scaffold the design and testing of their own algorithmic solutions to problems as they complete the course.

## Why study Algorithmics?
Computing is indispensable to modern society and is a key driver of innovation and progress. Computation is central to science and engineering, economics and finance, health and many aspects of lives. The contemporary scientific method relies extensively on simulation, virtual experimentation, computational analysis and prediction and is central to solving many of the problems we face such as climate change, social and organisational structural change, health and economic challenges and even in areas such as music and entertainment.

Algorithmics is the bedrock for all computational methods and with an understanding of using algorithms, their potential and limitations, and their history and ethical impacts, developing efficient computational solutions becomes possible.
